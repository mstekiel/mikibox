    Magnetization is calculated internally by :func:`magnetization`. :math:`\epsilon = 10^{-8}`

    ALL BELOW MADE A CRASH FOR ANOTER SYSTEM
    In calculations a dangerous trick is used. The :math:`\frac{1-exp(-\Delta_{m,n}/k_B T)}{\Delta_{m,n}}` 
    factor is computed as a matrix, so naturally it will be divergent on the diagonal, since :math:`\Delta_{m,n}=0` there. 
    This raises a RuntimeWarning which is ignored , and the diagonal is replaced with the :math:`1/k_B T` values, and the two summations are bundled together. 
    This feels dirty, but works so far, even for spin-half systems, which have degenerated energy levels.
    Maybe because the transitions between degenerated levels are not exactly 0 in the calculations (1e-15 rather).
